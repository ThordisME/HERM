What we have so far is:
- A register, baristas and a place for pickup (all basic resources).
- Customers, more of which should be coming in around rush hour.
- The process where a customer 1) enters the cafe, 2) waits to order, 3) orders, 4) waits while order is prepared, 5) picks up order.
What we need:
- Outlined in the Google doc
