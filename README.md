## !!! Important:

#### --> The cafe.ipynb and cafe.py fines in the main directory (the one you're in currently) are the final versions of each file. Ignore whetever's in each of our designated folders.

### Subject Matter: A café

Teacher: Ingunn Ýr Guðbrandsdóttir
TA: Arnar Jónsson

Some things to note:
- Each of us have our own designated folders.
  - We're working with individual folders instead of branches because two of us are new to git/GitHub, and we did not want there to be a learning curve.
- Our combined efforts are merged into the cafe.ipynb notebook in the main directory, as well as cafe.py (which is just the code cells from the notebook).
- We still have a "backup" branch, which is there just in case something important was accidentally overwritten on the main branch (unlikely with the setup, but never impossible).
