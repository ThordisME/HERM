# T-502-HERM: Simulation

*Briefly explain what the course is about.

"The focus of the course is to develop understanding of simulation concepts, and to clarify the advantages and limitations of simulation. We then look at discrete-event simulation using Simul8, a widely used simulation modeling language for a variety of application areas." <-- this is in the course description.

Teacher: Ingunn Ýr Guðbrandsdóttir
TA: Arnar Jónsson

*We should also prbably mention our names, maybe fun trivia like what we're studying.

### Subject Matter: A café

*Abbreviate much of what's in the final report. Basically just explain what's included in the code. 

*Also explain the repository's setup. Some important details:
- Each of us have our own designated folders.
  - We're working with individual folders instead of branches because two of the people are new to git/GitHub, and we did not want there to be a learning curve.
- Our combined efforts are merged into the cafe.ipynb notebook in the main directory.
- We still have a "backup" branch, which is there just in case something important was accidentally overwritten on the main branch (unlikely with the setup, but never impossible).
